# Technical Interview
For the last class, we are going to tackle the technical interview. The goal is to show students what is a typical technical interview and show them what they should expect as a manager. Each student will have a 15 min one-on-one interview with you. The idea is to make them talk about their project in **technical terms** because this is what will be the most useful for them (talk to their engineers in technical terms).

While you'll be interviewing each student, the rest of the group will have a challenge / test to measure what they learnt throughout the whole program. They can do this challenge in group or individually, it's up to them.


## Your goal:
* Show what is a technical interview
* Tell them what to expect as a manager
* Interview each student


## Rough Timing:
* 15 min: Introduction to Technical interview
* 12-15 min per student: Interview
* 10 min: Debrief of the interviews

## Other notes

* Show them the importance of talking with the right terms to engineers. They will be more convincing if they can actually talk to their engineering team in technical terms.
* Tell them that the test has to be done seriously so that they will be able to measure what part of the curriculum they have to review to improve their skills.
* Take a little time to debrief what you heard with the rest of the group. Those information can be really useful.
* The most important is to make sure you'll have time to interview EVERYBODY but if you know you have a little extra time, you can also help students with their challenge.


## Job Prep

* Come up with questions you'll ask to your students during the interviews. You'll find a list below to help you.
* If you want to bring someone else to help you with the interviews, feel free to do it.
