# Public Apis
Today's class will be an introduction to APIs. We'll use Dark Sky to show the current weather in our landing page as an example.

## Your goal:
* Introduce APIs to student
* Understand what is an HTTP request
* Show them what is an environment variable
* Show them what is JSON format
* Learn about AJAX request

## Rough Timing:
* 15 min: The Role of an API
* 5 min: Environment variable
* 45 min: Custom Routing Rails
* 30 min: Making an HTTP requests
* 5 min: JSON format
* 20 min: AJAX Request
* 30 min: Exercise 1 & 2


## Other notes:

* Before class, you can slack your students to sign up for Dark Sky so you don't waste time during class.
* If you don't have time for the second exercise about geolocation, it's alright, you can give it as homework to your students. The solution of this exercise is in the `solution.md` file.
