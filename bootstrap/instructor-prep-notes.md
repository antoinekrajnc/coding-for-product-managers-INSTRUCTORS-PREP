# Bootstrap
Today's class is about bootstrap. It's going to be really useful for our student to learn about this framework first because of its popularity but also because it's going to make everybody's blog easier to style.


## Your goal:
* Introduce Bootstrap and explain how it works
* Implement Bootstrap to the final project
* Insist on the grid system


## Rough Timing:
* 15 min: Why using Bootstrap
* 5 min: How to use Bootstrap
* 50 min: Bootstrap Grid System
* 20 min: Adding Bootstrap to rails
* 60 min: Adding Bootstrap to final project + Other themes


## Other notes

* Make sure the grid system is understood, it's the trickiest part.
* Sometimes students can be shy so make sure students are all set up with Bootstrap on their blog so that they can play with it even outside of class.
* Use Bootstrap documentation as much as possible so that students know where to refer if they want to use Bootstrap later on.


## Job Prep

* Some Bootstrap features are capricious, offsets for example don't work all the time (if you find why, please share it to PS Program Manager, he's been looking why for quite a while now). Make sure all the features you'll be using are working the way you want to.
