## Your goal:

* 30 min: How to configure Devise
* 40 min : Set up User model
* 20 min: Connect User & Posts
* 30 min: CanCanCan


## Other notes

* Explain cleary what is a Gem. You can spend a little time to walk your student through Ruby Gems documentation to help them understand. It's going to be very easier for them to understand the rest of the class.
* Make sure you differentiate authorization from authentication.
