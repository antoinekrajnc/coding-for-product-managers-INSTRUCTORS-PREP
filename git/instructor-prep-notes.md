# Git
Student will learn basics of Git and Github in this class. The goal is to show them how you can use git to create and edit repo inside Github.


## Your goal:
* Remind them basic terminal commands (cd, mkdir etc.)
* Show them git and its commands
* Make sure they understood the concept of staging, committing, merging and resetting
* How to apply git for Github


## Rough Timing:
* 30 min: Media Queries
* 45 min: Flexbox
* 15 min: cross browser compatibility
* 60 min: Exercises

## Other notes

* Show them MDN again and don't hesitate to make them use this resource during the exercises. Students don't have this reflex to go look for themselves when they don't know something yet.
* Take time on Flexbox. It is hard to understand that concept for students so you might need extra time depending on your class level.
* This class, you should have time for exercises. Don't hesitate to make them work in pairs. The goal is that they understand and memorize by practicing.


## Job Prep

Make sure you master **Box-positioning** and **Computer gallery** exercises before class starts.

Prepare the [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)). Your students will do the first levels with you in class. Don't complete all the 16 first levels if you see it's taking too much time. If you class takes too much time, move on and tell them they can finish at home. Answer questions at the end of class if they have.

To help you during class you can ask your students to read lecture-notes before the class starts and especially this [flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). They won't all read the notes so don't assume that when you come into class. However, students that have more difficulties to follow will.
