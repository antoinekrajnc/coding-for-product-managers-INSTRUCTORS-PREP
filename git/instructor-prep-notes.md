# Git
Student will learn basics of Git and Github in this class. The goal is to show them how you can use git to create and edit repo inside Github.


## Your goal:
* Remind them basic terminal commands (cd, mkdir etc.)
* Show them git and its commands
* Make sure they understood the concept of staging, committing, merging and resetting
* How to apply git for Github


## Rough Timing:
* 20 min: Terminal commands reminders
* 45 min: Git
* 45 min: How to interact with remote repo using Github
* 40 min: Exercises

## Other notes

* It happens sometimes that student get stuck using a command because they arrived in the Vi world. Tell them that `:q`or `:wq`should help them get out of there.
* Make sure to differenciate Git from Github in students' mind. Eventhough both are connected, it's not the same thing.


## Job Prep

* It's complicated for students to understand the concept of Git and how it can be related to Github eventhough the commands are simple. Make sure to reframe and repeat how it works on a broader level.
* A good way to make them understand git is to actually **draw branches on a whiteboard** it will greatly help you explaining branches but also commits, merge etc.
* Each time you explain a new command, try to go back on your whiteboard to explain it. It will give enough time to student to try that command and understand it.
