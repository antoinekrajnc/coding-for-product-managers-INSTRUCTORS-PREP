# Rails I
We're digging into serious stuff now: introducing Rails framework. This class will be mostly about what Rails is about, how is it different from Ruby and why it is very powerful.


## Your goal:
* Explain clearly MVC structure
* Show them rails data types
* Show how to add new models and how to migrate them into a database
* What is Active Record and why it is useful
* Dig deeper into Models and show what validations & associations are and what's the difference between instance methods vs class methods.


## Rough Timing:
* 40 min: MVC
* 10 min: Data Types
* 20 min: Adding, migrating and destroying models
* 40 min: Active Record and what is CRUD
* 40 min: Validations, associations, instance & class methods


## Other notes

* MVC is complicated to understand. Before class, you can ask your students on Slack to watch the videos on the Pre-class prep.
* Take time also to explain what is this concept of Convention over Configuration.
* Sometimes it helps to go over the different directories and explain roughly what they are for to make student understand why Rails is so useful.


## Job Prep

* Prepare some example of companies that use Ruby on Rails to show students that this is very useful.
