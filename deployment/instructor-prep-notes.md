# Deployment
This class, students will deploy their brand new blog on Heroku. This class is normally a lighter for you because if everything is alright, pushing their onto Heroku shouldn't trigger too many bugs.

## Your goal:
* Teach Basic Heroku functionalities
* Deploy the project

## Rough Timing:
* 15 min: Introduce Heroku
* 20 min: Add source control
* 20 min: Create your heroku app
* 50 min: Prepare your app for deploy I, II & III
* 30 min: Debugging
* 15 min: review homework, Q&A



## Other notes:

* Don't forget to show them how to hide sensitive information into .profile (API keys for dark sky)
* Normally you should have so many bugs that's why you might have extra-time. You can use it to review different part of the curriculum you'd like to spend more time on.


## Job Prep

Make sure you are familiar with Heroku functionalities.

In order to save time, you can slack your students to create a heroku account before class and ask them to get Heroku Toolbelt so that they can use Heroku command lines.
