# Intro to CSS
CSS part I is an intro to CSS. The goal is give student a first approach of CSS and teach them first key concepts of this language.


## Your goal:
* Show them different ways to implement styling into an HTML file
* Explain to them the different selectors in CSS
* Make them understand what is responsive design
* When and how to use flexbox

## Rough Timing:
* 15 min: In-line styling
* 15 min: Embedded styling
* 20 min: Linked stylesheet
* 40 min: selectors
* 15 min: Media Queries
* 45 min: Flexbox


## Other notes:

* Don't go too fast. Always keep in mind that most of the students discovered coding during their first class. They have a hard time to keep up with th class pace and not tell you. Make sure to ask often if you need to repeat some concepts.
* If you use often Chrome dev tools (or dev tools in different browser), repeat often how you display it and how you inspect element.
* Don't switch windows too fast. When you switch from Cloud 9 to the tab where you preview your code, take time at the beginning to explain how both are related. This sounds trivial but some students might get stuck because of that.
* Take time on Flexbox. It is hard to understand that concept for students so you might need extra time depending on your class level.



## Job Prep

After, the icebreaker, show them the website they are going to build by the end of the course

* [The project](http://p-school-blog.herokuapp.com)

Students might not see how complicated it can be to code such a website, so feel free to tell them that thanks to this project, they will have a better understanding of front-end and back-end development.

Make sure that you are familiar with Cloud 9. Sometimes this tool can be a little tricky or doesn't have the latest features of all programming languages. Students can also accidentally mess things up in their workspace and ask for your help, you need to be able to solve that quickly.

Make students write their first lines of code as soon as possible. Normally with Cloud 9 and Github, it should be enough to show them how to write headings, paragraphs etc. on a webpage.

This might seem trivial but show real websites that use what you are teaching them. It should be very easy with HTML. Students need to connect the dots with their work and understand how their engineering teams work.
