# Intro to CSS
CSS part I is an intro to CSS. The goal is give student a first approach of CSS and teach them first key concepts of this language.


## Your goal:
* Show them different ways to implement styling into an HTML file
* Explain to them the different selectors in CSS
* Make them understand what is responsive design
* When and how to use flexbox

## Rough Timing:
* 15 min: In-line styling
* 15 min: Embedded styling
* 20 min: Linked stylesheet
* 40 min: selectors
* 15 min: Media Queries
* 45 min: Flexbox


## Other notes:

* Don't go too fast. Always keep in mind that most of the students discovered coding two days ago. They might have a hard time to keep up with the class' pace and not tell you. Make sure to often ask if you need to repeat some concepts.
* If you use often Chrome dev tools (or dev tools in different browser), repeat often how you display it and how you inspect element.
* Don't switch windows too fast. When you switch from Cloud 9 to the tab where you preview your code, take time at the beginning to explain how both are related. This sounds trivial but some students might get stuck because of that.
* Take time on Flexbox. It is hard to understand that concept for students so you might need extra time depending on your class level.


## Job Prep

Prepare the [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)). Your students will do the first levels with you in class. To feel obliged to complete all the 16 first levels. If you class takes too much time, move on and tell them they can finish at home. Answer questions at the end of class if they have.

If your class is going fast, you might do also the [Flexbox Tower Defence](http://flexboxdefense.com/). Make sure you know how to do it if you need to.

To help you during class you can ask your students to read lecture-notes before the class starts and especially this [flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). They won't all read the notes so don't assume that when you come into class. However, students that have more difficulties to follow will and it will help them.
