# Intro to CSS
CSS part I is an intro to CSS. The goal is give student a first approach of CSS and teach them first key concepts of this language.


## Your goal:
* Show them different ways to implement styling into an HTML file
* Explain to them the different selectors in CSS


## Rough Timing:
* 20 min: In-line styling
* 20 min: Embedded styling
* 30 min: Linked stylesheet
* 40 min: selectors
* 40 min: Exercises



## Other notes:

* Don't go too fast. Always keep in mind that most of the students discovered coding two days ago. They might have a hard time to keep up with the class' pace and not tell you. Make sure to often ask if you need to repeat some concepts.
* If you use often Chrome dev tools (or dev tools in different browser), repeat often how you display it and how you inspect element.
* Don't switch windows too fast. When you switch from Cloud 9 to the tab where you preview your code, take time at the beginning to explain how both are related. This sounds trivial but some students might get stuck because of that.

## Job Prep

* Prepare some exercises to make students understand selectors and the different ways to embed styling on a webpage.
* If you don't have time, you can check the exercises.md file.
* Try to show them some cool and useful CSS properties.
* When it comes to colors, you can also show them the difference between hexadecimal and rgba and some resources on where to find nice colors.
