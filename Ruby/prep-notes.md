# Ruby
Today, you will teach students ruby basics. The idea is to make them able to write and understand ruby syntax when they will code their blog with Rails.


## Your goal:
* Show them what is a REPL and how it works
* Show them most important data types
* Explain what is Object Oriented Programming
* Make them understand basic logic of conditional statements, booleans and operators
* Make them understand function and classes


## Rough Timing:
* 20 min: Basic Data Types
* 20 min: Object Oriented Programming
* 40 min: Basic Logic
* 80 min: Advanced Data Types


## Other notes

* If `:q`doesn't work to exit the command, `exit + enter` should work
* Spend time explaining what is Object Oriented programming, if you feel that 20 min is not enough you can allocate more time.
* Basic logic should be easy for them to understand so you can spend more time on classes and function. Do as much practice as you can for this one. Spend explaining how a function works especially regarding parameters.
* `.each`loop can also be complicated. Make sure to spend time on it.


## Job Prep

* Be able to explain why we would use Hashes over Arrays.
* Tell the difference between Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
* Make sure you tell students what Ruby is for and connect it with what they learn so far (HTML, CSS, Git). You can even introduce briefly the MVC concept to make them understand that before we were focusing on the View but now we will be focusing on the backend with Rails but first, they need to understand what Ruby is.
