# Rails II
Today's class will dig into Controllers, Routes and Views. Students will learn how everything is connected in rails.


## Your goal:
* Explain what is Scaffolding
* Show them how Routes work
* Explain what controllers are and how to use them
* Start explaining how to handle views
* Show how MVC model is connected through the code more this time

## Rough Timing:
* 15 min: Scaffolding
* 25 min: Routes
* 1h20 min : Controllers
* 30 min: Views


## Other notes

* Last class you explained the MVC model in theory, this time you can spend more time to walk them through all the directories and files to show them how MVC works.
* Students can get lost very easily during this class because you have to switch files very often, make sure to repeat where you are and why you are here.
* You can ask students to do Zombies exercises before class or at least to watch the video before. It will show them basics that you would be able to review during class.

## Job Prep

* You will start to actually build the final project during rails II. Make sure you have the project in mind so that you can refer to it during class.
