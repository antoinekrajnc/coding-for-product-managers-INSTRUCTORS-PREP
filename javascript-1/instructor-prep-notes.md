# Javascript I
This class will be an introduction to Javascript. Student will learn basics of how to write a function, what are the typical data types and how this language differs from Ruby.

## Your goal:
* Teach JS data types
* Teach what is a function and how to create it
* Teach how to use loops in JS

## Rough Timing:
* 20 min: Intro + Practice 1
* 20 min: Practice 2
* 20 min: JS Syntax
* 30 min: JS functions
* 30 min: JS Objects & loops


## Other notes:

* Try to compare JS and Ruby as much as you can so that students can understand the differences between the two languages and not confuse the two.
* Insist on doing pair programming during the exercises so that it can be done faster. Those are a little harder than the one we used to put in the previous class.
* There are some additional exercises with solutions around functions so if you are running out of time, you can spend a little less time on functions and spend more on loops.

## Job Prep

Check the lecture-notes.md exercises. Some of them are purposely made so that the math calculations output something weird (a concatenation of string instead of actual math). Make sure you where it is so that you know when to tell your student to pay attention.

The idea with this is to show to students that JS is a language that will try to run "no matter what". Whereas  `"Hello"+ 5` in Ruby would return an error, it would return `Hello5` in JS Therefore it's really important to check data types.
