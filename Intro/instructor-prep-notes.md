# Hello World!
This class will be an intro to several tools to start coding, HTML and CSS. You will get to know your students a little better and why they are here. To re-emphasize, this program's goal is not to make students become software engineers but give them a better understanding of coding by making them write actual code.


## Your goal:
* Get to know everyone
* Understand student's expectation
* Set some expectations about the class
* Teach them basis of HTML and CSS

## Rough Timing:
* 5 min: Who you are
* 15 min: Icebreaking exercise
* 10 min: Welcome to the class and general overview
* 10 min: Make sure all students are set up with Cloud 9 and GitHub
* 30 min: Get to know the terminal and basic commands
* 45 min: HTML
* 45 min: CSS

## Other notes:

* Insist on the fact that you might use Google to answer some questions or double check your code and that it's TOTALLY normal.
* Students are current managers, they are used to "give orders" instead of receiving them. So don't forget to show how awesome you are when you introduce yourself.
* Include a break in your class. Students need at least one break during each class otherwise they will follow less.
* Make them comfortable asking many questions. Even stupid questions are welcome and you are happy to answer them.



Break the ice with by making your students talk. Let them introduce themselves and tell you why they sign up for the class.

Show them the website they are going to build by the end of the course
