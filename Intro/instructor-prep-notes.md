# Hello World!
This class will be an intro to several tools to start coding, HTML and CSS. You will get to know your students a little better and why they are here. To re-emphasize, this program's goal is not to make students become software engineers but give them a better understanding of coding by making them write actual code.


## Your goal:
* Get to know everyone
* Understand student's expectation
* Set some expectations about the class
* Teach them basis of the Command Line, HTML and CSS

## Rough Timing:
* 5 min: Who you are
* 15 min: Icebreaker exercise
* 10 min: Welcome to the class and general overview
* 10 min: Make sure all students are set up with Cloud 9 and GitHub
* 30 min: Get to know the terminal and basic commands
* 45 min: HTML
* 45 min: CSS

## Other notes:

* Insist on the fact that you might use Google to answer some questions or double check your code and that it's TOTALLY normal.
* Students are current managers, they are used to "give orders" instead of receiving them. So don't forget to show how awesome you are when you introduce yourself.
* Include a break in your class. Students need at least one break during each class otherwise they will follow less.
* Make them comfortable asking many questions. Even stupid questions are welcome and you are happy to answer them.


### Example of icebreaker games

Icebreaker games will be very useful for you because your students will be less shy to ask questions. If you don't know any icebreaker games you can check some [here](http://www.icebreakers.ws/large-group)


## Job Prep

After, the icebreaker, show them the website they are going to build by the end of the course

* [The project](http://p-school-blog.herokuapp.com)

Students might not see how complicated it can be to code such a website, so feel free to tell them that thanks to this project, they will have a better understanding of front-end and back-end development.

Make sure that you are familiar with Cloud 9. Sometimes this tool can be a little tricky or doesn't have the latest features of all programming languages. Students can also accidentally mess things up in their workspace and ask for your help, you need to be able to solve that quickly.

 Make students write their first lines of code as soon as possible. Normally with Cloud 9 and Github, it should be enough to show them how to write headings, paragraphs etc. on a webpage.

 This might seem trivial but show real websites that use what you are teaching them. It should be very easy with HTML and CSS. Students need to connect the dots with their work and understand how their engineering teams work.
