* Take time on Flexbox. It is hard to understand that concept for students so you might need extra time depending on your class level.

## Job Prep

Prepare the [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)). Your students will do the first levels with you in class. To feel obliged to complete all the 16 first levels. If you class takes too much time, move on and tell them they can finish at home. Answer questions at the end of class if they have.

If your class is going fast, you might do also the [Flexbox Tower Defence](http://flexboxdefense.com/). Make sure you know how to do it if you need to.

To help you during class you can ask your students to read lecture-notes before the class starts and especially this [flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). They won't all read the notes so don't assume that when you come into class. However, students that have more difficulties to follow will and it will help them.
