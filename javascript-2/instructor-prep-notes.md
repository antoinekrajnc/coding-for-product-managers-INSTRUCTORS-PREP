# Javascript II
This class will be about JQuery. We want to show how easier it is to use JQuery VS Vanilla Javascript and how popular this library is.

## Your goal:
* Show them what is the DOM
* Make them practice JQuery
* Include JQuery into their project

## Rough Timing:
* 40 min: DOM - JQuery Syntax
* 40 min: JQuery VS Vanilla JS
* 20 min: Including JQuery
* 50 min: JQuery & Rails


## Other notes:

* This class has a little less dense than the previous one so if you couldn't finish JS I last time, you can take time during this class to do extra exercises or answer questions.
* Insist on the difference between JQuery and Vanilla JS and show them how useful JQuery is.
* JQuery documentation (api.jquery.com) is very well made, you can also spend a little time explaining how it's organized
