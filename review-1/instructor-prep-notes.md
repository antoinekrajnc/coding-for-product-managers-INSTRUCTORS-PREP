# Review I
Today's class is about reviewing all the concepts that students have been learning since the beginning of the class. They are going to build a landing page during this class using html & css and will attach it to their rails application.

This time you will not go over the lecture notes. They are just here as guideline but the most important is the exercise: Building a landing/home page for their blog.

## Your goal:
* See which concepts students are still struggling on and re-explain them.
* Make everybody's application is working.
* Build a landing page for the final project

## Rough Timing:
* 1h10 min: Creating a new Route/ Controller in rails for the home page.
* 20 min: Touching up the blog
* 60 min: Either review Cancancan gem / have a Q&A session / Improving the landing page / Going further and talk about other programming languages (PHP, Python)


## Other notes:

* Put a priority on answering potential students' questions. Review sessions are here to make sure they understood key-concepts taught in the past classes.
* The second part of the class is a little more free so that you can do whatever you think is more important for your class.
* As it's hard to have questions right after the class starts, it's good to do the landing page exercise. Students will ask questions as the exercise goes.
* If you did everything you wanted to do and you have no questions, you can talk about other programming languages out there. DON'T MAKE THEM CODE in those languages, just talk about it and eventually about the latest and popular frameworks so that they have a better knowledge about tools engineers might use.

## Job Prep

The landing page is already coded in the "landing page" folder on github. This is just a template, you can make it look the way you want to for your students. Feel free to tweak it a little for your class. However, <strong>don't change the code inside the folder</strong>, change it inside your cloud9 workspace.

If you can't see the background image, check the path of the background image in the style.css file. The problem must come from here as there is a little difference between the path in rails or the path in the landing page folder.
