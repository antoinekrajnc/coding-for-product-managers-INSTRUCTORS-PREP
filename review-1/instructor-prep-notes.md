# Review I
Today's class is about reviewing all the concepts that students have been learning since the beginning of the class. They are going to build a landing page during this class

This time you will not go over the lecture notes. They are just here as guideline but the most important is the exercise: Building a landing/home page for their blog.

## Your goal:
* See which concepts students are still struggling on and re-explain them.
* Make everybody's application is working.
* Build a landing page

## Rough Timing:
* 15 min: Set up
* 60 min: Writing html
* 60 min: Writing CSS
* 15 min: Q&A

## Other notes:

* Pair Programming is super useful for that kind of exercise. However students are shy so you can insist a little bit at the beginning to make sure they are pair programming. No need to force it too much though
* Put a priority on answering potential students' questions. Review sessions are here to make sure they understood key-concepts taught in the past classes.
* As it's hard to have questions right after the class starts, it's good to do the landing page exercise. Students will ask questions as the exercise goes.
* If you did everything you wanted to do and you have no questions, you can talk about other programming languages out there. DON'T MAKE THEM CODE in those languages, just talk about it and eventually about the latest and popular frameworks so that they have a better knowledge about tools engineers might use.

## Job Prep

The landing page is already coded. You will see a landing-page folder with all the assets. Feel free to make changes if you want. However don't commit them on Github, just on your C9.

This exercise is made so that they can do it on their own. So don't worry about absolutely finishing it. The idea is to make sure they understand key-concepts of HTML / CSS & GIT

However we will use that landing page for Review 2, so make sure they finish it as homework.
